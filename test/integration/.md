# Integration

Tests in this folder should, most often, only mock:

- Network requests (using MSW)
- Components responsible for animation (because who wants to wait for that in your tests?)

They verify that several units work together in harmony.

For these, it will be important have a few things configured globally like automatically
resetting all mocks between tests. These may be seen as a subset of E2E tests. E2E
tests usually use the real application without any mock, whereas integration tests
might mock external services, e.g.: an API or a Cloud Service. Why don't we want to
write E2E over integration all the time? As good as Cypress is, having your tests
fail due to byzantine faults is not great (flaky test). We still want to run periodic
E2E tests on a project to ensure the most common user flows are working and to ensure
we catch unexpected breaking changes in APIs and services we consume.
