# Component

Just like regular unit tests, these Verify that individual, isolated parts work
as expected. We could use Cypress Component Test Runner, to test Vue components
directly in the browser. However, Cypress Component Test Runner, works awfully when
paired with Vite/Vitesse/PNPM. So, I would really just do regular old component tests
using JSDom and `@testling-library/vue` and `mount` directives. Most things will be
mocked, but some many not be, such as the main Pinia store. Also assertions may
sometimes enter the field of "integration" testing.
