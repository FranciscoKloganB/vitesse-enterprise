Typically these will run the entire application (both frontend and backend) and the test
will interact with the app just like a typical user would. These tests are written with
Cypress and are ran with Cypress Test Runner (unlike component tests which run with the
Cypress Component Test Runner).

Think of them as an helper robot that behaves like a user. It clicks around the app
and verifies that it functions correctly.

Cypress end-to-end tests should be placed in this directory.
