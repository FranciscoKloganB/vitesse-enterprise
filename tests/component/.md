# Component

Just like regular unit tests, these Verify that individual, isolated parts work
as expected. With a few differences, instead of using Jest to test modules, we
use Cypress Component Test Runner, to test Vue components directly in the browser.
Most things will be mocked, but some many not be, such as the main Pinia store. Also
assertions may sometimes enter the field of "integration" testing.
